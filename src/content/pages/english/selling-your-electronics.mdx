Sell your unused electronics with us and remove all the stress of selling. We handle everything:

* Valuation
* Listing
* Promotion
* Storage
* Packaging
* Postage
* Buyer communication

When your items sells, we will hold the funds for two weeks in order to cover returns. 

Commission starts at 30% of the final sale value. Here is an example breakdown of cost:

| Final Sale Price   | £100                |
| --------           | -------             |
| Postage            | £5                  |
| Commission         | £28.50 (30% of £95) |
| Returned to you    | **£66.50**          |

### Postage before commission

We tend to include postage into our listings, as this generally results in higher volume and quicker sales. Therefore we deduct this from the sale price before applying our commission.

### How long does it take?

We aim to have enough room to accomodate a large number of items. In many cases it may take a long time to sell your goods. We will endevour to get a good price for you and avoid auction, as this can lead to very disappointing results.
