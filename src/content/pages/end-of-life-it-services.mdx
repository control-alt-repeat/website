Got a pile of IT equipment building up in a broom cupboard? Contact us and we'll collect it free of charge. We aim to find a new home for all the devices we collect, this is through either: refurbishing, breaking down for parts, or recycling.

We operate within 30 minutes drive of Lancaster (LA1 4XQ) - Lancaster, Morecambe, Heysham, Carnforth, Kendal, Kirkby Lonsdale, South Lakes.

We are licensed to collect, store and dismantle all of the IT equipment that you have. See our [Certifications](/certifications) page for more information.

### What we take

- PCs
- Laptops
- Monitors
- Keyboards
- Mice
- Cables
- Components (drives, RAM)

_We cannot accept badly damaged equipment as we are not a recycling centre. We will accept items that appear in-tact but does not switch on, it's probably a simple fix or the parts can be reused._

### Data Sanitisation

It is vitally important that drives containing peronally identifiable information (PII) are appropriately sanitised. We use tools and practices which meet [NIST 800-88 r.1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-88r1.pdf) standards.

As a minimum we will purge your media. This will allow us to reuse them safe in the knowledge the data will be irretrievable even with an advanced laboratory.

If you're storing state secrets then we'd recommend looking for another supplier! However, if you feel that you do require physical destruction of your storage media we can pass on the costs of this to you.

## How it works?

1. [Contact us]("/contact") to arrange a visit or you can send us a photograph
2. Data sanitisation procedure is agreed
3. We collect all items from your premises
4. You receive a Waste Transfer Note (WTN)
5. Once processed, you will receive a data sanitisation certificate. We will give you an estimate of the lead time based on the amount of storage media received.
