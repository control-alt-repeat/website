## Returning Data

Due to media recovery often resulting in significant volumes of data, this is usually returned to you on an external USB HDD device. You can provide your own, or we can supply one at the cost for us to purchase. We recommend looking at Mr Memory for an idea of pricing. We purchase drives from [MrMemory](https://www.mrmemory.co.uk/all-products/all/#!usbharddrives=1) who provide a reliable and quick service. Cheap drives are often of poor qualty or take a long time to arrive due to being sent from overseas.

## HDD Failures

If your hard-disk drive has failed, we will recommend you to our partner Lazarus Data Recovery. They specialise in the difficult job of recovering data after a failure. We will discuss this with you at the time and can provide preferential costs versus going direct.

Clicking noises coming from your drive is a common fault. It is recommended not to power up the drive if this is happening to yours, as this can lead to a more expensive recovery. Lazarus provide further information about which you can read here: https://www.lazarusdatarecovery.com/blog/hard-drive-clicking-noise

If you decide to send your drive direct to Lazarus, we would appreciate you letting them know we sent you to them by using the code *CON030* in the booking form for _How did you find out about us?_
