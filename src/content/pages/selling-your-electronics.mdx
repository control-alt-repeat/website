Sell your unused electronics with us and remove the stress. We handle everything:

* Valuation
* Testing
* Listing
* Promotion
* Storage
* Packaging
* Postage
* Buyer communication

When your item sells, we will hold the funds for two weeks to cover returns. 

Commission starts at 30% of the final sale value. Here is an example breakdown of costs containing approximate values:

Please use this as a guide; contact us if you need a more specific quote. The above table must not be seen as guaranteed return value.

### eBay Fees

eBay charges us a fee for selling on their platform. The amount differs based on the item category and final sale value.

### Postage before commission

We tend to include postage in our listings, as this generally results in quicker sales. Therefore we deduct this from the sale price before applying our commission.

### How long does it take?

We aim to have enough room to accommodate a large number of items. In many cases it may take a long time to sell your goods. We will endeavour to get a good price for you and avoid auction, as this can lead to very disappointing results.
